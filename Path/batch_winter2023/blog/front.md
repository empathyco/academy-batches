### Rick&Morty JavaScript
Week one was a warmup for what it is to come. We came back to basics going over HTML, CSS & JS properties and main functionalities.
The idea behind these classes was mostly to learn about useful CSS properties like Grid or Flex.
The task to be done was a Web Browser that would make calls to a Rick&Morty API, displaying its characters in a responsive 
fashion.
