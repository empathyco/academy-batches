## Week 1
First week on the Frontend path of the Academy program at Empathy.co was focused on HTML, CSS & JS. We received several
classes regarding these topics, as well as some more in depth ones, like responsive CSS or JSDOM. The following were the
people in charge of delivering said classes.

**Key learning points** <!-- (Do not change this line!!!) -->
1. Basic HTML & CSS.
2. Responsive Design
3. JavaScript & Basic TypeScript
4. JSDOM & DevTool

### Rick&Morty JavaScript
Week one was a warmup for what it is to come. We came back to basics going over HTML, CSS & JS properties and main functionalities.
The idea behind these classes was mostly to learn about useful CSS properties like Grid or Flex.
The task to be done was a Web Browser that would make calls to a Rick&Morty API, displaying its characters in a responsive 
fashion.
