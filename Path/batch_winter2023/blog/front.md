# Week 1
First week on the Frontend path of the Academy program at Empathy.co was focused on HTML, CSS & JS. We received several
classes regarding these topics, as well as some more in depth ones, like responsive CSS or JSDOM. The following were the
people in charge of delivering said classes.

1. Basic HTML & CSS.
2. Responsive Design

### Rick&Morty (JS)
Week one was a warmup for what it is to come. We came back to basics going over HTML, CSS & JS properties and main functionalities.
The idea behind these classes was mostly to learn about useful CSS properties like Grid or Flex.
The task to be done was a Web Browser that would make calls to a Rick&Morty API, displaying it's characters in a responsive 
fashion.
