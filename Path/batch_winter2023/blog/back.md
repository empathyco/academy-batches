5. Introduction to HTTP and HTTP verbs
6. Introduction to REST

This first week of the path, we had two different classes, after having configured the tools necessary to run the exercises on the previous week.

### Session 1
The first session we got an introduction to Spring, how to inject dependencies, and the layered arquitecture we will use for the projects.  
Our first assignment consisted of making a component that could connect to Elastic and connecting our service classes to said component. Additionally, we had to make test to ensure this connection is established correctly and itrs referenced correctly.

### Session 2
For the second session that same week was about web APIs. In it we learned about the HTTP protocol, as well as HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and their correct uses. Also we talked about REST and its uses, as well as its architecture and how this is tied to out assignments on Spring.
