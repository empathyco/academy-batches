**Key learning points**
1. Introduction to Spring Framework

In this session we got an introduction to Spring, how to inject dependencies, and the layered arquitecture we will use for the projects.  
Our first assignment consisted of making a component that could connect to Elastic and connecting our service classes to said component. We had to make test to ensure this connection is established correctly and itrs referenced correctly. Also, we had to use Docker to be able to run our application and the Elasticsearch container.

**Key learning points**
1. Introduction to HTTP and HTTP verbs
2. Introduction to REST

The second session was about web APIs. In it we learned about the HTTP protocol, as well as HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and their correct uses. Also we talked about REST and its uses, as well as its architecture and how this is tied to out assignments on Spring. We had to do an individual exercise of creating an API for a CRUD of users using the HTTP verbs.

**Key learning points**
1. Uploading Multipart Files
2. Use of Async notation

In this third week we couldn't have the learning session but we were told to complete the Web Api exercise with a method that should upload a MultipartFile and then another with the same functionality but using the @Async annotation. The implementation of this approach can be found in the exercise 2 solution.

**Key learning points**
1. Index IMDb files

This week we had the fourth session and we continued with Web Apis. Roberto showed us a possible solution for the crud exercise and some of us shared our code so we review and comment it. In addition, he asked us to take a look to some imdb files that we are going to use for our project with the Frontend members and to start uploading and indexing them. He also showed us the JobRunr, a library for background processing in Java.
