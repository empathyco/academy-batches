## Week 1

#### Feb 27 - March 5

Our first week on the Data path of the Academy program at Empathy.co was focused on Spark. We received several classes regarding Spark, mainly learning about how to work with it and the several functions that this framework. The following people were the people in charge of delivering said classes.

| **Path Owner**   | **Content Deliverers** |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Daniel Hernandez | Daniel Hernández       |
|                  | David Casado           |

**Key learning points** <!-- (Do not change this line!!!)-->

1. Working with Spark and Scala
2. Learning about how to manage and query DataFrames
3. Learning about the Spark Functions
4. Learning about Spark Windows

### Spark exercises

Week one was a week of coming into contact with the framework and programming language that we will be using. We went over Spark and the functions that this framework has as well as some examples of code both in scala and python.

The idea behind this classes was to get acquainted with spark and querying over large datasets, getting the information needed about them and displaying them on the console or even saving them locally.

These are some examples made by the Academy Fellows (The repository is part of the company and private so someone not everyone might be able to see it):

## Week 2

#### March 6 - 12

Our second week on the Data path of the Academy program at Empathy.co was focused on databases. We received classes regarding PostgreSQL and MongoDB. We also kept on doing the Spark exercises of the week before. The following people were the ones in charge of delivering said classes.

| **Path Owner**   | **Content Deliverers** |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Daniel Hernandez | Jorge Yagüe París      |
|                  | David Casado Corona    |

**Key learning points** <!-- (Do not change this line!!!)-->

1. We kept on working with Spark and Scala
2. Learning about PostgreSQL: setting it up, storing data, and doing some exercises
3. Learning about MongoDB: setting it up in our local machine (either by brew or in a docker container), learning how to store and query data, etc
4. Do the MongoDB University - [Introduction to MongoDB](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/introduction-to-mongodb) course
5. Do the MongoDB University - [M121: The MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/m121-the-mongodb-aggregation-framework) course

### **PostgreSQL**

Our first class this week was hosted by Jorge and it was about learning how PostgreSQL works, which is an open source object-relational database system used at Motive in Amazon RDS (AWS Redshift).

The idea behind this classes was to get acquainted with setting up PostgreSQL in our local machine, connect to it and do some tests (create database, store data, select, insert).

### **MongoDB**

Our second class this week was hosted by David and it was about learning MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database program, that uses JSON-like documents (BSON). In this class we learned how to set it up in our local machine (either by brew or in a docker container) and we also did some tests (how documents are stored, do some queries, etc). We learned all the basics and some more advanced stuff like the aggregation framework.

To finish up, David explained to us the exercises we have to do for this module.

This week has been primarily about doing both courses, specially the one about the Aggregation Framework, and doing the exercises.

- #### [Angel's Branch](https://github.com/empathyco/academy-data-spark/tree/angel_iglesias_prestamo_academy_exercises)

### **Extra**

We attended _Sashimi-Tuesday: Workshop on Public Speaking, by Sam Gratton_ where we learned about public speaking, and "Internal Areas Review". Also, like very week, we had our weekly office hour, and our daily academy fellows update.

## Week 3

#### March 13 - 19

This third week of the Academy path was mainly focused on Queues. We learned two technologies, namely: Kinesis and Pub/Sub. In this regard, using both the _tagging_ and _enrichment_ projects as a reference, we learned how to send messages using a publish-subscribe Frameworks. Being Kinesis developed by AWS, while Pub/Sub is maintained by Google. Daniel was in charge of showing us how those are used in the context of Empathy.

**Key learning points** <!-- (Do not change this line!!!)-->

1. Working with two publish-subscribe Frameworks: Kinesis and Pub/Sub
2. Learning how Empathy uses them in real-life projects
3. Learning some code-guidelines used in the company

## English lessons

We started taking some English lessons where we discussed about ChatGPT and other AI models. We believe this complementary education will be a rewarding experience.

## Extra

We attended _Sashimi-Tuesday: Alba and Natalia with an "Introduction to UX Methodology"_ where we learned the importance of UX/UI for improving the products we build. What we believe is the most relevant is thinking about what the user will interact with the product you build, even if you are not a front-end developer.
