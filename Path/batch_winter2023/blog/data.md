### Spark exercises

Week one was a week of comming into contact with the framework and programming language that we will be using. We went over Spark and the functions that this framework has as well as some examples of code both in scala and python.

The idea behind this classes was to get acquiantanced with spark and querying over large datasets, getting the information needed about them and displaying them on the console or even saving them locally.

These are some examples made by the Academy Fellows (The repository is part of the company and private so someone not everyone might be able to see it):
