# Academy Summer 2023 Batch Wiki

Hi everyone! We are the Summer 2023 Batch of the Empathy.co Academy program. Even though each of us is based in a different side of the country, we are constantly in touch, learning from each other and growing as a team. Follow our journey throughout the experience and find out everything about what we have accomplished.

This Batch is a little different from the previous ones. This time, the software engineers and the business fellows will be divided in two general paths, without specialising before finding out what they really want to do with their future.

Get to know us in the following table! :smiley:
