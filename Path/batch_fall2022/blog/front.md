# Week 5

### Project IMDB: User Story

During the fifth week, we started planning and researching for the project that we would do with the Back and Search path. The project consists on fetching the data provided on the Back & Search API based on the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) to provide results so the user can discover new movies. Each frontend project would have their own special features. This week we started creating the repositories and their own Github Project. We also drafted the user stories for the project, where we went into detail about the features that we would like to develop for the web app.
